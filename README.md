# Mario Game in C++

Team: Adnan Can Büyükşirin,
      Efe Mert Çırpar


The project's objective is to create a single-person Mario game in which the player attempts to defeat every turtle while racking up as many points as possible. The Project makes use of the SFML library.

The SFML's "Graphics" and "Window" modules are used. For the game to run properly, all the dependencies must be added.

The project was written using Visual Studio IDE. Note that the code should be compiled in x64 architecture since the given SFML files require that.

This project was done as part of the Object-Oriented Programming (EHB354E) course.

The main menu and the game screen can be seen below:
